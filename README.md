HLL: helper functions for implementing a HLL approximate Riemann solver
Scheme: numerical scheme consisting of cell and interface objects at the lowest level and a domain control object used to manipulate the lower level cell and interface objects
Control: run the numerical scheme without plotting. Used for troubleshooting.

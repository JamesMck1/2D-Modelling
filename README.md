HLL.py: helper functions for implementing a HLL approximate Riemann solver

Scheme.py: numerical scheme consisting of cell and interface objects at the lowest level and a domain control object used to manipulate the lower level cell and interface objects

Control.py: run the numerical scheme without plotting. Used for troubleshooting.

Plotting Control.py: used to run the 2d scheme and plot the results.
